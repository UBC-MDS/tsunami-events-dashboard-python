**<span style="text-decoration:underline;">Communications:</span>**

For effective teamwork to occur there needs to be a free, open and professional expression of ideas and feelings at all times. Each team member takes responsibility to communicate their ideas, thoughts, and concerns. Respectful communication outside of the meetings will be through Zoom, Slack, or Github. Github will be the primary communication tool for ideas, suggestions, submitting work, and reviewing work. Slack will be the primary communication tool for informal communication and Zoom for scheduling meetings.

**<span style="text-decoration:underline;">Expectations:</span>**

The expected time spent on the project is 6-8 hours per week, and individual work will be managed by each member to meet the deadline as discussed by the group.  We are targeting to submit each project by the end of Friday each week, and will not leave the submission until the last minute on Saturday. Tasks that are dependent on other tasks in the week should be completed by Wednesday night. All group members are expected to meet the submission rubric and project requirements. The coding should have no syntax errors and the written analysis should be in the proper English grammatical format. Should a group member not be able to complete their task(s) and require assistance from other members, they should notify the rest of the group no later than Thursday night.

All members are expected to spend time discussing major changes together during group meetings and only submit a pull request for key issues that are not captured before on the repository for the group project on github.com.  Repository issues should be reviewed and responded to within 24 hours after creation. Slack response turnaround should be less than 12 hours.

**<span style="text-decoration:underline;">Meeting commitments:</span>**

Prior to each group meeting, we should finish reading all the milestone outlines and summaries. Meetings will be on Tuesdays (2 pm) during the lab and Fridays (11 am) to outline responsibilities, status check, and discuss submission. Also, group members are to be present on Zoom during lab time. Group members will meet online if needed as discussed in the Slack group channel.

**<span style="text-decoration:underline;">Roles:</span>**

There are 3 major roles that team members will be responsible for each week. The roles are as follows:

1. Scribe [1]:
    * Responsible for taking notes at the meetings and tagging them in a GitHub issue if needed.
    * Responsible for sharing all notes and meeting activities with teammates.
2. Proof-reader
    * Responsible for doing a final check of the submission before the deadline to make sure all project requirements are satisfied.
3. Submitter
    * Responsible for ensuring timely and accurate submission of the milestone.

Positions will be rotated each week to ensure that each team member does each position once.

**Milestone - I:**

* Scribe: Vadim
* Submitter: Gautham

**Milestone - II:**

* Scribe: Jacqueline
* Submitter: Rowan

**Milestone - III:**

* Scribe: Gautham
* Submitter: Vadim

**Milestone - IV:**

* Scribe: Rowan
* Submitter: Jacqueline

**<span style="text-decoration:underline;">Breach of Contract:</span>**

Failure to follow the team contract will result in a three-step warning system:

1. The first step is a written Slack notice that outlines the violation of the team contract and a reminder of the team contract conditions.
2. The second step is to meet and write an agreement that the behavior should be changed as instructed in the team contract.
3. The third step is to reach out to the lab instructor or TAs about the issues with the teammate.

Examples of contract breaches:

* No response to slack channel communication within 12 hours as agreed by the team
* No response to pull request in the GitHub within 24 hours as agreed by the team
* If not attending the meeting, 24-hour notice is required except for emergency
* Not able to complete individual tasks by the deadline agreed on and subsequently cause a late submission to our group project

**<span style="text-decoration:underline;">GitHub Expectations:</span>**

When working with our GitHub repo for the project, we will clone the project repo to our local environment. We will always work in the **dev** branch of the repo and will create new features for the project with new branches named `feature/feature_name` with the **dev** branch as the base branch. Once we are done with a feature, we will raise a pull request from the `feature/feature_name` branch to the **dev** branch which is where we will review and merge our features/fixes. We will only merge to the main branch once we all agree we have a final version of the deliverable for a particular milestone. This check will ensure that the main branch is always fully functional.

For each pull request made, two team members will review the changes before it is merged with the repoâ€™s **dev** branch. When making a PR  request, you are expected to ask your two assigned group members to review the request before merging. This will ensure we all get experience reviewing, merging, and creating pull requests.
