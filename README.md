# Tsunami Events Dashboard (Python)
A simple visualization dashboard for tsunami events since 1800 using plotly dash and Python.

This app will contain a landing page with three tiles; an interactive geographical map that users can pan across to see the location of each tsunami as well as its strength, a bar chart showing the number of deaths by country, and a table presenting the top 10 strongest tsunamis. All three graphics will be filterable by using the collapsible menu which contains two widgets; a slider to select a range of years and a dropdown menu to filter which countries they would like to see. The geographical map makes use of the latitude and longitude in the data set to identify locations where a tsunami occurred and will have a heat map to represent the magnitude of the tsunami as well as the ability for users to hover over a tsunami to glean more information about a particular tsunami. Similarly, users will also be able to use this feature in the table of strongest tsunamis which will have a dropdown to select the top 5, top 10, or top 20 strongest tsunamis of the chosen period. Lastly, the bar graph will show the number of deaths by country and is filterable by a period and countries.
